The product matrix has the number of rows of the first and the number of columns of the second. In the figure below, there are two matrices, 2x3 and 3x2, we can multiply these two because the rows in the first match the columns in the second. <p>\n","We multiply them by using the dot product. According to the figure below, we take the dot product of the first row of the first matrix and the first column of the second matrix, and place that in the top left spot in the product. Then take the product of the same row with the next column in the second matrix and continue until the last column in the second. Then you move onto the second row in the first matrix and do the same until the last row in the first matrix.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"w6XmceS8WlxQ","colab_type":"text"},"source":["$$\\begin{bmatrix}\n","    a  &  b  &  c     \\\\\n","    d  &  e  &  f\n","\\end{bmatrix}\n","\\times\n","\\begin{bmatrix}\n","    g  &  h      \\\\\n","    i  &  j      \\\\\n","    k  &  l\n","\\end{bmatrix}\n","=\n","\\begin{bmatrix}\n","    (a \\times g) + (b \\times i) + (c \\times k) &       (a \\times h) + (b \\times j) + (c \\times l) \\\\      (d \\times g) + (e \\times i) + (f \\times k) &  \n","    (d \\times h) + (e \\times j) + (f \\times l) \\\\\n","\\end{bmatrix}$$"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"BNjG0GU163iw","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## multiply_matrices\n","This function takes an arbitrary number of matrices and multiplies these together to find the matrix product.
